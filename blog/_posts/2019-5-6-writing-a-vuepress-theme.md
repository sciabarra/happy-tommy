# Writing a VuePress theme

To write a theme, create a `.vuepress/theme` directory in your docs root, and then create a `Layout.vue` file:

```
.
└─ .vuepress
   └─ `theme`
       └─ Layout.vue
```

From there it's the same as developing a normal Vue application. It is entirely up to you how to organize your theme.
